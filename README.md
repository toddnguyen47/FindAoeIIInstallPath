# OVERVIEW
This is a quicker way to install WolololKingdoms and Voobly. I zipped all the files required to run it on Voobly. All you need to do is install WolololKingdoms mod and a few other minor tweaks and you're done.

# STEP 1

1. Download `Voobly_AoeII.zip` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Wt3T3mNRzze0nKxTX_H0wlh8WkNjQwAV)
If you cannot open zip files, download and install [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
2. Ask me for the password to the zipped file.
3. Unzip the `Voobly_AoeII.zip` file. You should now have a folder called `OpenThisFolder`. Open this folder as well.
4. Try the *Easy Method* mentioned below first. If that does not work, then try the *Manual Method*.

## Step 1A: Easy Method
5. Run `FindAoEII.exe`. Don't worry, I wrote this program so it's perfectly safe.
6. Click on `Find AoE II Path`. If the program cannot find a path, supply in the textbox where you installed your Age of Empires II game. For example, I installed my AoE II at `Z:\Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD\ ` so I would copy + paste this path into the textbox.
7. Click on `Copy Files`. You're done!

## Step 1B: Manual Method

5. Within `AoeII_Voobly` folder, copy all the files to where you installed AoE II. For example, I installed my AoE II at `Z:\Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD\ `, so I would copy all files into the folder above. The 20+ files in the zipped file will exist alongside the files that Steam installed.
6. If you need help finding where you installed your AoE II, you can use a program I wrote to find the path:

```

# STEP 2
1. Download and install [Voobly](https://www.voobly.com/)
2. Log in, then go into the `New Player Lobby` under `Age of Empires II - Conquerors`
3. If Voobly asks to install any new files, let it install. You will possibly have to sign into Voobly again after the installation. That is perfectly normal!

# STEP 3
1. Download and install [WololoKingdoms](https://github.com/AoE2CommunityGitHub/WololoKingdoms/releases/download/5.8.1/WololoKingdoms.5.8.1.exe)
2. Run and install the WololoKingdoms Converter.

# STEP 4
1. Host a sample game on Voobly and set up Voobly, following Step 6B and 6C.
